Teams building systems for the MOJ should avoid code freezes whenever
possible as they generally increase the risks to your service and those
services around it.

While code freezes are intended to reduce uncertainty and change when
making changes to a system, they are typically a symptom of low trust
in existing change processes around a given system, or of a previous
traumatic event in the system's past.

In most cases, it is better to make the system safer to change through
[smaller, more regular changes](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly)
because [regular releases reduce risk](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/11/02/regular-releases-reduce-risk/).

## Code freezes introduce many risks

## Code freezes can be appropriate in limited circumstances
